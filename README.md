# 📁 FileServer

**Simple. Fast. No Bloat.**

FileServer is a lightweight standalone HTTP server that serves files — nothing more, nothing less.  
No frameworks, just 2 lines of config, no nonsense.

Instead of spinning up an entire backend stack or uploading to cloud drives just to share files,  
**you clone this repo, build it, drop files in `public/`, and run.**
